        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
          <p>
            For this project moving forward proved to be surpringly difficult, as the mobile application of this concept is rather difficult and daunting to approach.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through extensive research, I discovered that one of the main difficulties with the difference between applying a concept to a desktop situation versus a mobile application is the kind of operating systems and code involved.
          </p>

          <p>
            For general desktop application, everything you need is running through the active browser(s). This means the information is slightly easier to access and (with it all using the standard http operating system, the method for retrieving information is standard and foesn't change.)
          </p>

          <p>
            For mobile application, the added difficulty includes: the requirement of permissions to access the information of internet accessing applications on the device, the varying ways these applications access the internet and how this may/will effects the coding of the program itself, and also how the information will get presented to the user (especially if it's a seperate application, what encouragement is there to swap between active applications to check this information is there?). Another factor that will also impact it is, will this application monitor only active applications, or even applications on the mobile device that are connected to the internet and sending/recieving information in the background (and how does this effect the development of the application concept?).
          </p>
          <p>
          To help myself move forward with the development of this project, I found I got quite caught up in the theoretical side, and how the application of this concept could be approached once I moved into the coding itself (the more daunting part of this project for me, considering I am not a strong coder).
          </p>
          <p>
          My main focus of this project, was implimenting code such as the jQuery cookie library (which functions like a JaveScript API). However, I was having issues and could not get the jQuery cookies library to work (this is due to the fact I didn't really understand it properly). Ideally, I wanted to be able to notify that there's a cookie on the page, what it's called and what it's doing. This is a challenge for me, having never before(aside from briefly for project one) opted out of coding for the final product, so I have never used any API system either, so this was an interesting challenge to try and overcome. 
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
          <p>
            My limited time frame for this project due to outside effects also greatly halted my beginning of this project, which meant I was trying to learn things I'd never looked into with considerable time restraint. This and my lack of knowledge of JavaScript coding language (which proved slightly easier to implement than the jQuery cookie library) were my main challenges for this. One other challenge was this concept was originally designed to be mobile specific, but this was coded for desktop. This was more due to the lack of my understanding of code and how these all corrilate and work together. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to build on the previous project where I'd managed to implement the creation of a cookie and show this by counting the times you viewed the page (recognised by said cookie). This was surprisingly difficult. Again, this was just due to the technical difficulties I have understanding the code, but this prrocess helped to highlight some areas of focus that need building on -- and how hard it is to balance the theory and technical sides of the development process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Understanding how to implement cookies information in a code environment is just one step closer to developing my concept, but without the knowledge of how to do this, ttaking the leap to devloping the concept further will become too much of a technical challenge and I feel it would be too overwhelming to attempt without actuallly understanding at least some of the basics/groundings of these technologies. 
          </p>
          <p2>
          On a side note, I also had technical difficulties which resulting in my loosing all my work, this is a quicker done recreation of what I'd tried to achieve.

          <p>
          Here is the new cookie experiement I did -- I wanted to create read and delete cookie buttons so you could begin to interact with the cookies on this page (unfortunately I was unsuccessful in making it so you coudl interact with other cookies on your computer, but I am slowly beginning to understand how cookies function).
          </p>

      </form>

      Note: you have to refresh the page to get back after pressing the button.
