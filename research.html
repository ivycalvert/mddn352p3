          <h2>  RESEARCH </h2>

<p>
  Cookies are data that are stored as small text files on your computer. Cookie were initially developed to solve the problem of servers forgetting information about users (this is referred to as a “state-less” transaction). When a web page is sent to a browser from a server, the connection is then shut down (and the server forgets all the information about the user). The implementation of cookies enables the user to revisit the site and have the cookie “remember” the user for the server. Cookies attached to a sites are part of the request for the webpage that the browser calls from the server (this way the server can read the cookies ‘unique identifier’ strong of text and determine if the browser is one that has visited before).
</p>

<p>
   Programs on the server side of the transaction can read the cookie, deciding if the user has access to the site and any personalised settings. Each time the site is visited, information about the user is available. This can both add a valuable aspect for the user experience, and endanger user privacy. Fortunately for the latter, most browsers offer the user the opportunity to manage cookies (i.e. delete them).
</p>

<p>
  Cookies do not contain software programs, so cannot install anything on a computer. However, they do serve a variety of purposes:
    <li>
      Remember site preferences.
    </li>
    <li>
      Understand how users interact and use the site.
    </li>
    <li>
      For services that require logging in, cookies provide security (information such as the email address used and the users name are stored. Only the site signed up with this information can access this).
    </li>
    <li>
      Advertising management on sites (these tend to cause the most controversy, especially when websites use a separate cookie for the advertising delivery company. These cookies record when and where the user sees the advert, location in the world and whether or not it was clicked). These cookies are known as third-party advertising cookies (they learn the personalised behaviours of the users, so more targeted adverts will get displayed. This increases the chance of the users interacting with the advertisements as they are targeted specifically for them).
    </li>

  <h3>Do note there are other forms of tracking online:</h3>
    <li>
      Flash cookies (locally shared objects): information stored by Adobe Flash (such as video volume preferences, or online game scores). These can not be deleted the way other cookies are deleted, meaning many companies use them as ‘backup cookies’ that load traditional cookies back onto the users computer even after these have been deleted.
    </li>
    <li>
      Server logs: this is when the server logs the type of request that was made when loading the site, storing information such as the users IP address, the date and time the browser loaded the page, what page was loaded, and what site/page the user  came from before loading this page (this type of tracking forms the basis for web analytics, and can only be viewed by the owner of the site). 
    </li>
    <li>
      Web beacons: small object embedded in the site not visible to the user. These are commonly referred to as ‘tags’, ‘tracking bugs’, ‘pixel hackers’ or ‘pixel gifs’. Simple functionality of these can be a tiny clear image the size of a pixel, when the serve is called to load the page this image is loaded. This ‘server call’ allows companies to know if the site was viewed. This is useful to companies as it lets them know if users are opening emails, however this system is commonly used by spammers to identify active email accounts by including these within the email (if it is opened, then the email is active). Web beacons are mainly useful to advertisers who display adverts on another persons website to allow them to see how often the advert appears.

      <h2> PERSONAL OBSTACLES </h2>
        <p>
          Research into using new code languages I haven't used before (such as JavaScript) was important for the development and functionality of what this project aims to achieve. For this project, I implemented javascript cookies to begin my understanding both of how javascript works as a coding language and also how cookies (and other trackable information methods) can be used. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned the basics of JavaScript cookies as I progressed through the development of this project. JavaScript is primarily used for storing preferences when considering the implementation of cookies. Cookies only store a small amount of data: a name-value pair, the expiry date, and the domain and path of the server.
          name-value: this pair contains actual information.
          expiry date: this determines when the cookie is trashed by the browser (if not determined in the code, the cookie is trashed when the browser is closed).
          domain and path: domain tells the browser where the cookie should be sent (if not set, this is the domain of the current page). The domain blows cookies to cross sub-domains (however cookies cannot be set to domains not currently in). Path determines the directory where the cookie is active (usually the path is set to "/" so it is valid throughout the entire domain). 

          The property I implemented into my site was “document.cookie” allows javascript to create, read, and erase cookies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another aspect of developing this idea that was very important, was researching how cookies and multiple forms of tracking occurs. Being able to understand the functionality of cookies and how third party trackers tag computers via the visited sites is fundamental to  the functionality of this concept.
